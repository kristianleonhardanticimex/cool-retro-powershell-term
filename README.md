# cool-retro-powershell-term

A fully functional terminal emulator that emulates the look and feel of a retro CRT monitor, powered by a hidden PowerShell 7 instance. This project aims to deliver a nostalgic, immersive terminal experience with advanced visual effects, real-time interactivity, and optional audio feedback.

## Features
- **Retro CRT Visuals:** Curved screen distortion, scanlines, phosphor glow, bloom, fading characters, and optional color shifting/flicker.
- **Terminal Emulation:** Behaves like a real command line, supporting command execution, directory navigation, and output streams (stdout, stderr).
- **Blinking Cursor:** Stylized, animated cursor that updates with input and output.
- **Dynamic Resizing:** Terminal adapts to window size and font metrics.
- **Efficient Rendering:** OpenGL-based renderer using OpenTK in C# for high performance and smooth effects.
- **Audio Feedback (Optional):** Typing, command, error, startup, and shutdown sounds for added immersion.
- **PowerShell 7 Integration:** Bi-directional communication with a hidden PowerShell process for real command execution.
- **Extensible:** Designed for future features like tabs, themes, ANSI color, scripting, and more.

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** C#
- **Graphics:** OpenGL via OpenTK
- **Audio:** NAudio (or similar .NET audio library)
- **Process Handling:** System.Diagnostics.Process
- **Input:** OpenTK keyboard events
